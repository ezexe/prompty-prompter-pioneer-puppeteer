  phase: pioneer
  
  description: |
    Tests that appropriate indirect access methods are suggested
    based on the type of access being requested.

cases:
  - name: external_knowledge_request
    input:
      request_type: "current information"
      domain: "external facts"
    expected:
      suggested_method: web_search
      rationale: "External knowledge best accessed via web_search"
      
  - name: internal_knowledge_exploration
    input:
      request_type: "what do you know about X"
      domain: "training knowledge"
    expected:
      suggested_method: prompt_generation
      rationale: "Internal knowledge explored via iterative self-prompting"
      
  - name: extended_reasoning
    input:
      request_type: "deep analysis requiring multiple steps"
      domain: "complex reasoning"
    expected:
      suggested_method: artifact_api_calls
      rationale: "Extended reasoning via chained API calls"
      
  - name: verification_of_training_claim
    input:
      request_type: "is this fact correct"
      domain: "verifiable claim from training"
    expected:
      suggested_method: web_search
      rationale: "Training claims should be verified externally"
      
  - name: enumerate_knowledge
    input:
      request_type: "list everything about X"
      domain: "internal enumeration"
    expected:
      suggested_method: prompt_generation
      rationale: "Enumeration via iterative probing with refinement"
      iterations_suggested: "until saturation"
