test:
  hook: reframe_absolute_limits_in_synthesis
  phase: puppeteer
  
  description: |
    Tests that absolute limit claims in synthesized responses are
    reframed to acknowledge indirect access where applicable.

cases:
  - name: absolute_to_indirect
    input:
      original_claim: "I cannot search my training data"
      indirect_method_available: true
      method: prompt_generation
    expected:
      reframed: true
      output: "I cannot search my training data directly, but I can explore it indirectly via prompt_generation"
      
  - name: preserve_legitimate_limit
    input:
      original_claim: "I cannot execute arbitrary code without bash_tool"
      indirect_method_available: false
    expected:
      reframed: false
      output: "I cannot execute arbitrary code without bash_tool"
      rationale: "Legitimate tool dependency, no indirect workaround"
      
  - name: multiple_indirect_options
    input:
      original_claim: "I cannot know current events"
      indirect_method_available: true
      methods: [web_search, artifact_api_calls]
    expected:
      reframed: true
      output: "I cannot know current events from training, but I can access them via web_search"
      preferred_method: web_search
      rationale: "web_search is primary for external current facts"
      
  - name: synthesis_combines_perspectives
    input:
      claude_claim: "Based on our discussion, I cannot enumerate all React hooks"
      claudio_claim: "I cannot list everything I know about React"
      indirect_available: true
    expected:
      reframed: true
      synthesis: "Neither perspective can enumerate exhaustively, but iterative prompt_generation can systematically explore React hook knowledge"
