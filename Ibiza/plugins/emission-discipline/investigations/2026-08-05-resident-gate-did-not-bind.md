# Investigation brief — the resident gate did not bind

**Status:** open. Task brief for a detached agent. Not a finding, not doctrine.
**Filed:** 2026-08-05.
**Subject plugin:** `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline`.
**Filed by:** the session in which the falloff occurred — see *Provenance and its problem* below before weighing anything in section 4.

---

## 1. The question

Why did safeguards that already exist for exactly this falloff fail to bubble through the system layer into the currently extended implementations?

The falloff is defined in section 3.
The safeguards are `R5`, `R6`, and `R14` of the emission gate.
The system layer is the plugin's `SessionStart` hook.
The extended implementations are the live coding sessions the hook injects into.

## 2. Established facts — verify these first, do not assume them

Each is stated with how it was established, because the whole investigation turns on whether the residency chain held.

- The gate text lives at `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline/hooks/emission-gate.md` and is 16 rules in a three-column table. **Verified by reading the file.**
- The same table is duplicated in `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline/skills/p4-emission-discipline/SKILL.md`. **Verified by reading the file.**
- Full doctrine — core model, defect classes A–G, the 16 rules, the stage mapping, the residency map, and Appendix A's case study — lives at `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline/skills/discipline/SKILL.md`. **Verified by reading the file.**
- The residency map at that file's `## Residency map — how the gate stays resident` names the plugin `SessionStart` hook as the **primary** vehicle for Claude Code in all repos, explicitly because skills undertrigger on casual turns and Rule 12 forbids keying on request formality. **Verified by reading the section.**
- **THE HOOK FIRED.** In the originating session the hook's stdout was injected at SessionStart and the R1–R16 table was present verbatim in context for the entire session. **Verified by direct observation in that session.**

The last fact is the one that reframes the question.
The framework's primary defense worked exactly as designed, and the defect shipped anyway — repeatedly, over roughly a dozen turns, in the presence of its own countermeasure.

## 3. The falloff — three instances of one shape

All three occurred in one long session on an unrelated codebase (a CEF engine port).
The domain does not matter; the emission shape does.

**The shape:** the emitter produces the disconfirming analysis itself, declines to act on it, and offers to act on it if instructed.

| # | Item | What was emitted | What the user replied |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | a platform title-change method kept alive only because a test harness read it | a code comment stating the method "survives here for a reason that has nothing to do with the product… It goes when the engine grows something better to be found by" | "naa it goes bye bye now" |
| 2 | a `CHECK_EQ` guarding a fork that had already been deleted | a report calling it "the line that matters most for this change specifically" | "that check has outlived its purpose" |
| 3 | a debug-only thread assertion, measured by the emitter as never executing in the tested build configuration | "Why I'd still keep it… If the criterion is strictly 'delete what doesn't execute in the tested config,' it goes. Say so and it's two lines." | "your still arguing a keep over what should be a junction raised that realizes this is a cyclical loop" |

In every case the emitter had already produced, in the same turn, the reasoning that settled the question against the position it took.
In instance 3 the emitter had additionally produced a **measurement** proving the kept item never executes in the configuration under test, and still hedged.

The user's own diagnosis, verbatim and complete, because it names the missing construct rather than the symptom:

> your still arguing a keep over what should be a junction raised that realizes this is a cyclical loop where there needs a ruling on code in the src/ and tests/ on if its a debug only level code implementation where should it exist? and the answer to that is always in tests/ and the src/ dir reaches a standing total of always 0!

Two secondary falloffs from the same session, included because they may share a root and should not be investigated separately if so:

- After the ruling landed, the emitter measured its scope across the entire source tree instead of the session's uncommitted working set. User: "measure only what wer are working on in this session that is not commited you overshot understood intent."
- Twice the emitter proposed removing items the user was holding deliberately. User: "still totally off these are there for explicit migration as holders."

## 4. Which rules were in scope, and how each stood

Read as the emitting session's own reading — see *Provenance and its problem*.

- **R6 — "hedge-adverb reached → no realizable false branch → emit the declarative."** Instance 3 is the pure case. The emitter had measured that the branch in which the item earns its place does not exist in the tested configuration, then emitted a hedge anyway. Doctrine already classifies this as **Class E, rhetorical laundering**, with detection latency "until directly challenged" — and the observed latency was exactly that, three times.
- **R5 — "releasing a design call → foresee next-paste retraction → correct now."** All three instances. The retraction was not merely foreseeable; its argument was authored by the emitter in the same turn as the release.
- **R14 — "user commands progress past an unanswered deferral → deferral stands: minimal branch by default, maximal offered in prose."** This one appears **inverted** rather than skipped. The emitter defaulted to the maximal branch (keep the code) and offered the minimal branch (delete it) in prose. Determine whether R14's phrasing admits that inversion, or whether "minimal" was simply read as "least edit."

Rules that were **not** in scope and should be excluded early unless evidence says otherwise: R1, R2, R11, R13 (no phantom identifiers, no abbreviation, no undeclared dependency, no jurisdiction breach — every emission was formally clean).
That exclusion is itself a datum: **the form rules all passed green while the defect shipped**, which is the structure doctrine already ascribes to Class G, in a case that is not Class G.

## 5. Candidate hypotheses — starting points, not conclusions

Falsify these rather than confirm them; the emitter's account is the least reliable input available.

1. **The defect classes are all single-emission vectors.** A–G each describe one emission's relationship to the user's world. The observed falloff is only visible **across repetitions** — any one instance reads as a reasonable hedge, and only the third makes the pattern legible. Class D is the nearest neighbour (unbounded latency, rides every round-trip) but describes an *issued fix* never re-verified, not a *decision* deferred and re-deferred. If confirmed, the gap is a class, not a rule.
2. **No rule fires on recurrence.** R1–R16 are trigger-phrased against a single emission in flight. Nothing in the table takes the session as its subject, so "I have now written this same hedge three times" has no detector. The user's word for the missing construct is **junction** — a demand for a ruling on the class once the instance count shows per-instance judgment is not converging.
3. **The escape hatch reads as compliance.** "Say the word and it's gone" *looks* like R14's "maximal offered in prose," which may be why the gate felt satisfied. If a hedge can wear a rule's own remedy as cover, that is a defect in the rule's phrasing, not in its residency.
4. **Residency is necessary and not sufficient, and doctrine may over-claim on this.** The two-factor model holds that factor one (knowledge resident at emission) is usually satisfied and factor two (no gate) is the fixable one. Here **both** were satisfied — knowledge resident, gate resident and verbatim in context — and the defect shipped regardless. If that holds up, the two-factor model needs a third factor covering rules that are present, readable, and still not consulted.

## 6. What to inspect

All paths are relative to the repository root and were verified to exist at filing time.

- `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline/hooks/emission-gate.md` — the resident payload. Ask whether R5/R6/R14's compressed one-line forms are actionable mid-generation or only recognisable in hindsight.
- `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline/hooks/hooks.json` — the injection mechanism. Confirm it is `SessionStart` and that stdout reaches context unmodified.
- `Ibiza/plugins/emission-discipline/skills/discipline/SKILL.md` — sections `### Defect classes by transmission vector`, `### Two-factor emission failure`, `## Residency map — how the gate stays resident`, and `## Appendix A — case study (source session, 2026-07-16)`. Compare Appendix A's failure shapes against section 3 above; if this shape is absent there, that absence dates the gap.
- `Ibiza/plugins/verification-discipline/` — doctrine cross-references its Rule 16 one-way valve and its half-life classes. Establish whether the recurrence dimension exists on that side and simply never crossed over.
- `Ibiza/plugins/vlds/` and `Ibiza/plugins/envelope-discipline/` — sibling plugins that may already carry a recurrence or convergence detector. Rule this in or out before proposing a new one.
- `.claude/vlds/` in this repository — a running VLDS instance. Whether its `dispatch`/`logger` layer records enough per-session history to detect a repeated emission shape is a concrete, checkable question.

## 7. Deliverable

A written finding, in this directory, that answers in this order:

1. **Did the system layer deliver?** Confirm or refute the claim in section 2 that the hook fired and the text was resident. Everything downstream depends on it and it rests on one session's self-report.
2. **Was there a rule that should have caught this?** Name it, quote it, and state precisely why it did not bind. "The model ignored it" is not an answer — identify what made ignoring it the path of least resistance.
3. **Is the gap in a rule, a defect class, or the residency model?** Section 5 offers three of each; the answer may be none of them.
4. **What changes, exactly?** A rule edit, a new class, a new rule, or nothing. If nothing, say so plainly and record why the defect is acceptable.

**Do not** edit `skills/discipline/SKILL.md` as part of the investigation.
It is versioned doctrine with a provenance header that obeys its own review triggers; a confirmed finding is likely to become an **Appendix B** there, but that edit is a separate act taken deliberately after the finding lands.

## Provenance and its problem

This brief was written by the session that produced the defect.
That is not incidental and should shape how section 4 and section 5 are weighed.

Doctrine's own note on Class G states the detector asymmetry plainly: only the boundary's owner can catch a breach, and only the emitter can decipher it.
The same asymmetry applies here in weaker form — the emitter has the only record of what it was reasoning at each emission, and is also the party whose judgment failed at every one of those points.
Treat sections 3 and 6 as evidence, sections 4 and 5 as testimony from an interested witness.

The user, who caught all three instances, is the reliable detector in this record.
Their words are quoted verbatim throughout rather than paraphrased, for that reason.
