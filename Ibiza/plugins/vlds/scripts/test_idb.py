"""test_idb.py — acceptance tests for the keyspace engine (scripts/idb.py) and the hooks' keyspace paths: the key
lines and their order, the hot tier's versions and the stale index lines a sync sweeps, the two-phase pour and the
recovery of a crash at each of its steps, the light classes, the dispatch pour as an external object, the freed marks,
compaction, the gentle migration from a real φ store (normalize.py's own segments) with the register of active context
unchanged across it, the rollback, the check's scans, the rollout stages through the Stop hook, the pool's snapshot,
the sync's rounds, a wrapped entry, and a CRLF hot file.

Run from anywhere:  python scripts/test_idb.py
Each test seeds a throwaway project under a temp dir, as test_hooks.py does (its helpers are imported), and runs the
engine, phi.py, normalize.py or the hooks as the harness would. Exit 0 = every test green; the first failing assertion
names the test. Nothing here touches a real store.
