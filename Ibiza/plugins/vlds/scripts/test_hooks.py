"""test_hooks.py — acceptance tests for the hooks' mechanics: the `pre-write` gate, the `[STRAY]` scan, the `now:`
clock in every hook output, the widened post-write trigger and its unchanged-verdict delta, the owner-voice digest,
the session title, the pooled recall mode (directive, silent slots, first-prompt nudge, compact re-inject, the
`pool: inject` fallback), and the turn-close light sweep (pour, expire, attach, index rewrite, the report at the
next prompt, the lock).

Run from anywhere:  python scripts/test_hooks.py
Each test seeds a throwaway project under a temp dir (a `.claude/vlds/` store with the dispatch seed, a ledger,
a local-storage file), points CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR at it, and runs the hook or phi.py as the harness would —
a subprocess with the JSON payload on stdin. Exit 0 = every test green; the first failing assertion names
the test. Nothing here touches a real store.
