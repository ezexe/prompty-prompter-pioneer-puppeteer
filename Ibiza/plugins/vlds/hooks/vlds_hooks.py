"""vlds_hooks.py — the VLDS plugin's hook bodies: mechanical and judgment-free, in the phi.py mold.

Subcommands, each reading the harness's JSON payload on stdin (decoded as UTF-8 — the harness writes UTF-8
whatever the console codepage says):
  session-open            SessionStart, the recall's index slot: print the clock (`now:`), the recall mode, a
                          digest of phi-index.md (register, hot rows, updated), a digest line per hot file, the
                          owner-voice digest, and the verdict of `phi.py check`. In the POOLED mode — the
                          default — the hot files are not injected at all: the slot prints the directive under
                          which the judged store operations are the operator subagent's (hooks/operator-prompt.md
                          is its brief) and its derivation is what the model acts on — open (the pool at the first
                          prompt per hooks/pool-prompt.md, scoped to the task the model derives in one line, pulled
                          into context in place of the files; the barrier on a candidate row; the intent of an
                          unknown short message) and sweep (scoring what is cold; scripts/normalize.py --pour places
                          it) — while the close is mechanical: the model writes the turn's record and
                          scripts/record.py applies it. One operator per session, continued for at most
                          `operator-moments:` moments then relaunched. `pool: inject` in the index's `## recall`
                          section restores the slot injection of every inject file; `operator-model:`, `pool-model:`
                          and `sweep-model:` name the models. On
                          `source` resume, fork, or compact print only the clock, the digest lines, and the
                          verdict — the conversation already holds its own recall — and on a compact re-inject
                          store/recall-pool.md when it is this session's, since the compaction may have
                          summarized the recall away; and record the session id in `.sessions`, so a fork's
                          first prompt (a new id over a live conversation) and a pre-hook session's next prompt
                          do not pour rows that are still live.
  session-open --slot N   SessionStart, one chunk slot (the `pool: inject` mode only; silent when pooled): the
                          index's `inject:` files are split at entry boundaries into chunks under the harness's
                          per-hook output cap, and slot N prints the N-th chunk (header with the first chunk of
                          each file). Nothing on resume / fork / compact, nothing when the plan is shorter than
                          N+1. One hook per slot, because the harness caps EACH hook's output at 10,000
                          characters: one process printing everything would be spilled to a file and replaced by
                          a preview. A single entry over the cap, or a chunk beyond the registered slots, arrives
                          as a marker line to read by hand.
  prompt-open             UserPromptSubmit: print the clock, stamp the message's dispatch row (fingerprint /
                          time / arrival) and run the mechanical half of the dispatch barrier: when no earlier
                          row's fingerprint resembles the message (token overlap under BARRIER_JACCARD, or not
                          identical for a message under BARRIER_MIN_TOKENS tokens) the row gets `state: FRESH`
                          here; when one does, the candidate is named and `state:` is left for the operator
                          subagent's judgment — ECHO, SUPERSEDED, or a fresh ask that merely reads alike. A
                          message of at most SHORT_WORDS words is called short: one the store's owner corpus
                          already holds KNOWN_SHORT_MIN times is a known command — never a candidate, its last
                          addressed: printed as the derivation, no operator — and an unknown one goes to the
                          operator for its intent before the model answers; `addressed:` is the record's at the
                          turn's close. A
                          task notification (a background task's completion, delivered as a prompt) is never an
                          ask: its row is stamped complete on arrival — arrival `task notification`, FRESH,
                          addressed as consumed — because a row left open there would be closed by an operator
                          whose own completion arrives the same way, a loop with no floor.
                          Then, on the FIRST prompt a session id ever submits, pour dispatch.md whole-file into arc/ — a sha-verified
                          byte-identical copy, then a reseed that preserves the file's own header (a user's
                          header edit is a ruling). Every output names the session by its short id and, when
                          the transcript's last custom-title record gives one, its chat title — the id stays
                          for reference because a title can change, and .sessions maps id to title; when the
                          transcript lags the hook (it is written asynchronously), the title .sessions recorded
                          at an earlier prompt is used; the poured copy is named after the id of the session
                          whose rows it holds.
  pre-write               PreToolUse: when a Write, Edit, Bash, or PowerShell call is about to write a file
                          that carries a store file's NAME, ask before it lands anywhere but a `.claude/vlds/`
                          directory (the path is resolved against the call's cwd and any `cd` earlier in the
                          same command — a bare `ledger.md` that was true under one `cd` is false under
                          another), ask before a persisted entry carries a placeholder `time:` (`12:4x`,
                          `TBD`) instead of a stamp copied from the stream's `now:`, and ask before one carries
                          a `time:` guessed AHEAD of the clock — later than the write's own `now:` by more than
                          a minute (one session stamped rows up to fifty minutes ahead). Silent otherwise. Always
                          `ask`, never `deny`: `index.md` and `ledger.md` are legitimate names in a docs tree,
                          and only the user can say which this one is.
  pre-ask                 PreToolUse on AskUserQuestion and any mcp__*__show_widget: when briefs.md holds a
                          standing label (a class the owner ruled standing at its second instance), every
                          option's brief — a widget's `.elicit-pill` inner text, a panel option's description
                          — must carry one `<label>:` line; a picker missing one is DENIED with the labels, the
                          count that made each standing, and the options that lack them, so the model re-issues
                          the informed picker and the owner never sees the thin one. Keyed once per picker
                          fingerprint (the widget's title, the panel's question texts) in store/.pre-ask: the
                          re-issue passes even if still thin — a bounce is a nudge, not a wall. Silent when
                          nothing is standing, when every option carries every label, and on meta options
                          (all of the above, other). The recorder half is prompt-open's: a prompt that is neither
                          the elicitation shell's submit line nor its skip, arriving right after a served
                          picker, is stamped `kind: detail-ask` / `on: <picker>` (a submit whose textbox carries
                          a question, `kind: submit+detail-ask`), and the close names the omitted class in
                          briefs.md — the judgment no hook can make, since transcripts keep no reasoning; a
                          picker's submit or skip whose resembling rows are all addressed is written FRESH by
                          construction, never handed to the operator.
  post-write              PostToolUse: when a Write, Edit, Bash, or PowerShell call touched the store, or wrote
                          a store-named file anywhere, print the clock and run `phi.py check`, handing its
                          verdict back as additionalContext — a mis-homed write is followed at once by a check
                          whose `[STRAY]` line names the file. The full verdict is handed back when it differs
                          from the last one this session saw; an unchanged verdict comes back as one line, so a
                          turn of store writes does not re-paste the same debt list into the context each time.
  turn-close              Stop: the light normalize sweep, mechanical — scripts/normalize.py --light under the
                          sweep lock: attach a hook-poured dispatch record where a live segment has room, expire
                          and pour the virtual entries another session minted, pour the logger's oldest past its
                          budget — every step through phi.py's gates — then leave its one-line report in
                          store/.turn-close for the next prompt hook to print, since a Stop hook's stdout never
                          reaches the model. Nothing to move: silent. Lock held elsewhere: skipped, said so.

Everything here is mechanical. The stamp carries no judgment; the pour moves a file whose every entry belongs to
a conversation that is not this one (a new id that reaches its first prompt unrecorded) and destroys nothing (the
copy is verified before the reseed, and the copy stays); the check only reports; the pre-write gate only asks.
What the hooks never do: register the poured file in the index (a sweep's judged act), pour any other hot file
by judgment (the light classes are counted, not scored), judge a dispatch row (the hook writes FRESH only when no
earlier row resembles the message; the judged state and addressed are the operator subagent's), delete or move a
stray file (the user disposes of it), or block a prompt — every failure prints a one-line notice and exits 0.

The clock: every subcommand's output carries a `now: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` line, so a store write anywhere in the
turn has an authoritative stamp to copy — the model never guesses a digit.

First-prompt detection: `<store>/.sessions` holds one line per session id that has submitted a prompt or been
recorded at a resume / fork / compact start. An id absent from it at its first prompt is a new session; a resumed
conversation keeps its id, a fork is recorded at its SessionStart, and a transient SessionStart firing never
submits a prompt — so a live conversation's rows are never poured out from under it.
