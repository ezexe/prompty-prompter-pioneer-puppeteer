"""frag_gate.py — src-fragger's mechanical arm: a PreToolUse ask before agent-written files land where they die.

Subcommand `frag-gate`, reading the harness's JSON payload on stdin (decoded as UTF-8): for a Write or Edit,
the file_path; for a Bash or PowerShell command, every write-position path (redirects, tee, the PowerShell
content cmdlets, python's open() in a write mode, cp / mv destinations). Three cases ask — never deny:

  the harness scratchpad   ANY file written into the per-session temp directory the system prompt names
                           (`.../Temp/claude/<project>/<session>/scratchpad/`): code belongs under
                           `<store>/src/<task>/` as a frag; everything else belongs under the project's own
                           `.claude/scratchpad/`, which the user can see and which outlives the session
  any other temp location  a CODE file (by extension) written to /tmp, the user's temp directory, and their
                           spellings — a frag belongs under `<store>/src/<task>/`
  a project scratchpad     a CODE file (by extension) written under any `.claude/scratchpad/` — where a swap
                           script lands once it has stopped calling itself a frag; the ask carries the floor:
                           a program whose job no single tool call does is a frag under `<store>/src/<task>/`,
                           and an edit, an append, a whole-file write, or one shell command is the tool's own
                           call and no file

Silent for everything else: files under the project tree are the project's; a scratchpad's notes, logs, and
fixtures are working files; data a tool drops in /tmp is normal. Every failure prints a one-line notice and exits 0 — a gate that crashes the call it guards is worse
than no gate.
