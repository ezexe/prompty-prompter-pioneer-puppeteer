"""test_frag_gate.py — acceptance tests for the frag gate: anything into the harness scratchpad asks, code
into any other temp location asks, code (by extension or by name) into any project's .claude/scratchpad/
asks (the split and the floor: the notebook is git-ignored, a frag is tracked under src/, and a tool call is
no file), and files under the store's src/, non-code files in the project's scratchpad, or the project tree
pass. Then the SessionStart hook: it seeds src/frags.md and the notebook's own `.gitignore` of `*`,
overwrites neither, and says in one line when the project's root rules ignore src/. Run from anywhere:
python hooks/test_frag_gate.py — exit 0 = green (the hook cases skip, saying so, without sh or git on
