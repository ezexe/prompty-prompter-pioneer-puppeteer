# /p4-prompter

The **prompter** stage of the P4 runtime pipeline — resolve the closure.

Closure to resolve: $closure

Run the resolver — it reads each skill's `metadata.p4` and computes the closure, so there is no need to resolve it by hand.
From the roboto plugin root (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when installed, or `Ibiza/plugins/roboto/` in the source repo), run:

```sh
python scripts/p4.py resolve $closure
```

It prints the closure's members (`identity` + `rubric` are always-on), the skills pulled by tier, the active P4 gates, and `dependencies_satisfied` with any `missing_dependencies`.
How it resolves: members = the skills whose `metadata.p4.tiers` lists the closure; `depends_on` is two id-spaces (skill names + P4 gate ids); `optional_depends_on` enhances but is not required for closure.

**Output:** the resolver's report.
