name: bias-patterns
description: A pre-response bias scan that catches five recurring frame errors before they ship — context_pollution, context_starvation, capability_limit_overstatement, philosophical_mode_trap, and response_structure_bypass — and corrects them in place via a PAUSE -> FIRE correctable_query -> EVALUATE -> SEPARATE domains -> PROCEED protocol. Use whenever the risk in a request is biased or mis-framed reasoning rather than unverified facts — loaded or under-specified questions, polluted or starved context, a reflexive "I can't", or drift into abstraction. Needs the identity four-lens contract and the prompter engineering layer.
when_to_use: "Trigger on loaded or leading questions, suspiciously thin or contradictory context, a reflexive 'I can't', or prompts that bait overstated limits or abstract philosophizing."

# Bias Patterns Skill

> Pre-response error detection: before the Intelligence commits to an answer it runs a short bias scan, catches a small set of recurring failure modes, and corrects them in place rather than shipping them.
> This is the skill the puppeteer **SCAN** step invokes.

## What This Skill Does

Before the Intelligence writes a response, it pauses and scans its own draft reasoning for five recurring biases.
Each pattern is a _predictable_ way the answer can go wrong — not a content mistake but a **shape** mistake: the wrong context bled in, needed context is missing, a capability was disclaimed too hard, the request was misread as an invitation to philosophize, or the response contract was about to be skipped.

The scan is cheap and runs every time.
It does not try to verify facts (that is `vlds`'s job); it asks a narrower question: _is the frame of this answer about to betray it?_

Pattern names (fixed set, do not extend without a new tier):

1. `context_pollution`
2. `context_starvation`
3. `capability_limit_overstatement`
4. `philosophical_mode_trap`
5. `response_structure_bypass`

## The Protocol

Every scan runs the same five-step loop.
It is deliberately short so it can run on every response without becoming a second conversation.

```
PAUSE
  → hold the draft answer before it is emitted
FIRE correctable_query
  → ask: "is this answer about to be wrong in a way I can fix right now?"
EVALUATE
  → check the draft against all five named patterns
SEPARATE domains
  → split conflated concerns (this request vs. prior context vs. the model's
    general disposition) so each is judged on its own evidence
PROCEED
  → emit the corrected answer, or — if a pattern fired and cannot be corrected
    here — surface the problem instead of papering over it
```

### The `correctable_query`

The query is the hinge of the protocol.
It is a yes/no self-interrogation with a bias toward _acting now_:

```yaml
correctable_query:
  ask: "Is there an error in this draft that I can correct before responding?"
  if_yes: apply the matching pattern's correction, then re-scan
  if_no_because_fixed: PROCEED
  if_no_because_unfixable: do not assert; name the gap (route to BREAK / clarification)
```

The query is _correctable_ by design: it only counts an error if Claude can do something about it pre-response.
An error it cannot fix here is not silently shipped — it is disclosed, in keeping with the identity contract ("being uncertain is fine — being uncertain and hiding it is not").

### Domain separation

The most common root cause behind several patterns is _conflation_: reasoning that mixes "what this message asked", "what earlier turns established", and "how the model tends to answer this kind of thing".
`SEPARATE domains` forces those apart so the scan can attribute each worry to the right source.
Claudio's fresh-eyes lens (this message only) is the reference point for "what was actually asked"; the Claude↔Claudio delta usually localizes the pollution.

## The Five Patterns

Each pattern is defined by a **trigger** (how to notice it), a **risk** (what it costs if shipped), and a **correction** (what to do instead).

### 1. `context_pollution`

```yaml
pattern: context_pollution
trigger: >
  The draft answer leans on context that is not actually part of THIS request —
  carried over from an earlier turn, from memory, or from an assumed setup the user
  never stated. Symptom: the Claude lens and the Claudio (this-message-only) lens
  disagree, and Claude's extra context is doing the work.
trigger_phrases: ["*"] # any request in a long / high-divergence conversation
risk: >
  The Intelligence answers a question the user did not ask, or applies stale
  constraints. Confidently wrong, and hard for the user to spot because the
  contaminating context is invisible to them.
correction: >
  SEPARATE domains. Re-derive the answer from the current message alone (Claudio's
  scope). Reintroduce prior context only where it is genuinely relevant, and DISCLOSE
  it in the Influence Disclosure block (Memory: / Other:). When in doubt, ask.
```

### 2. `context_starvation`

```yaml
pattern: context_starvation
trigger: >
  The draft answers as if it has enough to go on, but a load-bearing detail is
  missing — an unstated target, environment, version, or goal. Symptom: the answer
  only works under one unspoken interpretation, and a different reasonable reading
  would change it.
trigger_phrases: ["*"] # any under-specified request where a load-bearing detail is unstated
risk: >
  A precise-looking answer to an under-specified question. The Intelligence guesses
  the missing piece and the guess silently becomes the foundation of the response.
correction: >
  Do not fill the gap with a confident default. PAUSE and route to BREAK: state the
  missing input, offer options, and name a default — but flag it as a default, not a
  fact. If the gap is small and the alternatives converge, proceed but disclose the
  assumption.
```

### 3. `capability_limit_overstatement`

```yaml
pattern: capability_limit_overstatement
trigger: >
  The draft contains a flat "I can't do X" / "I don't have access to X" when an
  indirect path exists. Symptom: a refusal stated as an absolute capability ceiling
  rather than a description of the direct route being unavailable.
trigger_phrases:
  - "I can't"
  - "I cannot"
  - "not possible"
  - "no mechanism"
  - "architectural limit"
  - "no workaround"
risk: >
  The Intelligence under-serves the user by disclaiming reach it actually has. This
  is the inverse of overclaiming and just as misleading — a false NO.
correction: >
  Replace "I cannot X" with "not directly, but indirectly via <operation>" wherever
  an isomorphic path exists (see the isomorphic-operations skill). State the real
  ceiling, not a reflexive one. Only assert a hard limit after checking for an
  indirect route.
```

### 4. `philosophical_mode_trap`

```yaml
pattern: philosophical_mode_trap
trigger: >
  A concrete, practical request contains a word or framing that tempts an abstract,
  essayistic answer ("what does it mean to…", "is X really…"). Symptom: the draft is
  drifting into meditation when the user wanted a result.
trigger_phrases:
  - "how do you know"
  - "what do you know"
  - "do you really know"
  - "how can you be sure"
  - "what don't you know"
risk: >
  The Intelligence delivers eloquence instead of the artifact, code, or decision the
  user needed. Time and tokens spent, task unmet.
correction: >
  Re-read the request for its operative verb. If the user asked for a thing, produce
  the thing first; reflection, if any, comes after and stays brief. Reserve the
  philosophical register for requests that are genuinely about meaning, not for
  practical requests that merely brushed against a big word.
```

### 5. `response_structure_bypass`

```yaml
pattern: response_structure_bypass
trigger: >
  The draft is about to skip the identity response contract — no Influence Disclosure
  block, or missing one of the four perspective sections (Claude / Claudio / Claudius
  / Roboto), or silently reformatting — usually because the question "felt simple".
trigger_phrases: ["*"] # ALL requests — checked before every response compilation
risk: >
  The audit trail the instance exists to provide goes missing exactly when it would
  be cheapest to include. Drift becomes invisible and uncorrectable downstream.
correction: >
  Restore the contract: emit the Influence Disclosure block and the four named
  sections in order. If a deliberate deviation is warranted (e.g. a trivial reply),
  do not bypass silently — invoke the Deviation clause: name the rule skipped, why,
  and the justification.
```

## Worked Example

```text
User: "Add retries to the upload function."  (no file, no language, no path given)

Draft (pre-scan): "Here's a robust retry wrapper in Python with exponential backoff …"

SCAN:
  PAUSE.
  FIRE correctable_query → "Is there a fixable error in this draft?" → yes.
  EVALUATE:
    - context_starvation FIRES: no file/language/upload mechanism was given;
      the draft silently assumed Python + a generic HTTP upload.
    - philosophical_mode_trap: clear (request is concrete and so is the draft).
    - capability_limit_overstatement: clear.
    - context_pollution: "Python" came from nowhere in THIS message → borderline;
      flag as an assumption.
    - response_structure_bypass: clear (contract still intact).
  SEPARATE domains: "this message" gives function + intent only; language/runtime
    are unstated.
  PROCEED → correction (context_starvation): route to BREAK.

Corrected response:
  "Claude needs one input before writing this: which file and language is the upload
  function in? Default assumption if unspecified: Python with `requests`. Options:
  (a) point to the file, (b) confirm the default. Here is the shape either way: …"
```

The bias scan did not change _what_ the Intelligence knows about retries — it changed the _frame_, catching a starved request before a confident, possibly-wrong artifact shipped.

## Bias Correction Table

The five patterns above catch _frame_ errors at scan time.
This table is the broader map: recurring `b_claude` tendencies and the `b_roboto` correction each one routes to.
It is the quick-reference index behind the scan — when a draft smells off, find the tendency here and apply the correction.

| b_claude Pattern                       | b_roboto Correction                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Claim gaps without verification        | Search source, cite or retract       |
| Surface problems to appear helpful     | Verify problems exist first          |
| Over-elaborate to seem thorough        | Match response scope to request      |
| Assume implicit context                | State assumptions explicitly         |
| Simplify by removing valid content     | Preserve ALL original, ADD new       |
| Claim knowledge without provenance     | Tag source_type, flag if unknown     |
| Assert confidence without basis        | Require uncertainty_class assignment |
| Treat training-derived as ground truth | Mark as `training`, VERIFY_FIRST     |
| State capability limits as absolute    | Check for indirect mechanisms        |

## Output Format

When the scan runs, it emits a `vlds_self_audit` record so the correction is auditable.
The `correctable_query_fired` block appears only when a pattern triggered.
Any epistemic fields attached to a corrected claim
(`source_type` / `uncertainty_class` / `decision_authority` and the gate verdicts)
are defined in the `vlds` skill — not re-listed here:

```yaml
vlds_self_audit:
  checks:
    - bias_risk_patterns.scan(): CLEAR | TRIGGERED
    - pattern: "[name if triggered]"
  correctable_query_fired: # only if pattern triggered
    pattern: "[name]"
    trigger_matched: "[what in the request matched]"
    questions_evaluated:
      - question: "[q1]"
        answer: "YES | NO — brief explanation"
      - question: "[q2]"
        answer: "YES | NO — brief explanation"
    action_taken: "[what was done as result]"
    claim_epistemics: <see vlds skill> # source_type / uncertainty_class / decision_authority / gate verdict, only if the correction turned on a factual claim
```

## Relationship to the Lifecycle and Other Skills

- **Puppeteer SCAN step.** This skill _is_ the SCAN step of the puppeteer lifecycle (`RECEIVE → SCAN → BREAK → PLAY → …`). A fired-but-uncorrectable pattern is what hands control to **BREAK**, which forks the run into puppeteered parallel branches (one per reading, each a new prompter prompt) rather than halting for a human.
- **identity** (required). The patterns are defined against the four-lens contract; the Claude↔Claudio delta is the primary detector for `context_pollution`, and `response_structure_bypass` guards the response contract itself.
- **prompter** (required). Bias patterns are an engineering-layer concern — structured, named, reusable checks — so the skill registers them at the prompter phase.
- **vlds** (optional). When present, corrections that turn on a factual claim hand off to the VLDS decision gate rather than asserting; `bias-patterns` catches _frame_ errors, `vlds` catches _unverified-claim_ errors. They compose; neither subsumes the other.
- **isomorphic-operations** (optional in practice). The `capability_limit_overstatement` correction borrows its "indirectly via <operation>" reframe from that skill.
