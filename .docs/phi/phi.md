## The Recursive Tree

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 0: return 0
    elif n == 1: return 1
    else: return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Every time you go up one number (e.g., from 5 to 6), you aren't just adding one branch—you are re-growing the entire tree from two steps ago as a side branch. (6) contains a full (5) tree on the left and a full (4) tree on the right.

Exactly how many **(1)**s and **(0)**s (the base cases) it takes to build the final number? Here is the full, un-cached expansion:

```
* fib(0) --> 0

* fib(2) --> 1
  (2)

* fib(3) --> 2

These aren't competing systems. They're both projections of the same structure.

## The Native Object

The Fibonacci recurrence is a linear map. Applied once, it advances a pair of consecutive values by one step:

```
[F(k+1)]   [1 1]   [F(k)  ]
[F(k)  ] = [1 0] × [F(k-1)]
```

Applied n times, it produces:

```
M^n = [F(n+1)  F(n)  ]
      [F(n)    F(n-1)]
```

Four entries. Three distinct values (the matrix is symmetric: `[0,1] = [1,0]`). One recurrence linking them: `[0][0] = [0][1] + [1][1]`, i.e. `F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1)`. The recurrence isn't a rule imposed on the entries — it's readable directly off the geometry. Row/column structure _is_ the recurrence.

This matrix is the native object. Everything else — the 1D register, binary, the adjacency constraint, the Fibonacci delimiter — is a cipher on top of it.

## Four Projections of One Fact

**1. The Adjacency Constraint.** In a flat Zeckendorf register, each cell is an independent switch with a Fibonacci weight. The weights have a dependency — `F(k) + F(k+1) = F(k+2)` — but the cells don't know about it. Independent addressing + dependent weights = redundancy. The no-adjacent-1s rule is duct tape over a dimensional mismatch: a 2D relationship forced into a 1D address space.

**2. The Matrix Symmetry.** In the matrix, `[0,1]` and `[1,0]` both give `F(n)`. Two addresses, one value. The redundancy that the 1D register forbids, the matrix expresses as symmetry. Four states, three distinct outputs. In 1D, one of four states is _forbidden_. In 2D, one of four states is _redundant_.

**3. The Fibonacci Coding Delimiter.** The bit pattern `11` can never appear inside a valid Zeckendorf representation. So it's repurposed as an end-of-number marker in Fibonacci codes. This works because `11` corresponds to the redundant matrix state — `[1,1]` selects `F(n-1)`, which carries no information that `[0,0]` and `[0,1]` don't already determine. The delimiter falls out of the matrix's symmetry.

**4. The Weight Sequence Fork.** Let `11` live as a valid state and the adjacency constraint vanishes. With it goes the Fibonacci weight sequence — the next position no longer needs weight `F(k+2)` because the carry that would have produced it was absorbed. The weights collapse to powers of 2.

```
Allow [1,1]:   weights = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16...    → binary
Forbid [1,1]:  weights = 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... → Fibonacci
Same matrix. Different cipher.
```

## The Axiom

One identity generates everything:

**F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)**

This isn't a formula you derive — it's the law of the machine. The carry rule, the borrow rule, addition, subtraction, normalization, and error detection all fall out of reading this identity in different directions.

## The Register

A register is an ordered sequence of cells. Each cell holds 0 or 1. Cell _k_ has weight F(k). A register is **valid** when no two adjacent cells both hold 1.

The first self-referential property: the number of valid states in an _n_-cell register is F(n+2). The machine counts its own capacity in its own number system.

## Arithmetic from the Single Identity

Three operations, all just the axiom rewritten:

**Upward (carry):** Cells k and k+1 both hold 1? Clear both, set cell k+2. That's just F(k) + F(k+1) = F(k+2) — the axiom read left to right.

**Downward (borrow):** Cell k holds 1 and you need to decompose it? Clear k, set cells k-1 and k-2. That's F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) — the axiom read right to left.

**Doubling (resolve a 2):** Raw addition can produce a cell holding "2." Since 2·F(k) = F(k+1) + F(k-2), clear the 2 and set those two cells. This is the axiom applied to F(k) + F(k) = F(k) + F(k-1) + F(k-2) = F(k+1) + F(k-2).

That's the complete arithmetic engine. Addition is raw cell-wise sum followed by sweeping these three rules until the register is valid. Subtraction is alignment plus downward expansion plus normalization. Every operation terminates because carries propagate strictly upward and the register is finite.

## The Clock is Convergence

There's no external clock. You pour values into a register, and the normalization rules cascade like a wavefront until the system settles into a valid state. **Computation is settling.** The settling time is bounded by register width, so it always halts — but the machine's natural rhythm is the propagation speed of carries, not an imposed tick.

This is closer to how physical systems actually compute. A crystal grows until it's stable. A river finds its channel. The φ-register normalizes.

## Error Detection is Free

In any positional system with unconstrained digits, every bit pattern is valid and corruption is silent. Here, the "no adjacent 1s" invariant means any corruption that creates an adjacency is **immediately visible** — and self-correcting by applying the carry rule. The representation itself is a checksum. You don't bolt on parity bits; structural integrity is native.

## Multiplication

Left-shift by one position scales a value by approximately φ. Not exactly — the result may need normalization — but the _structure_ is that shifting is φ-scaling, and the normalization cleanup is bounded.

Multiplying by F(k) specifically: decompose via the recurrence. F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2), so `x · F(k) = x · F(k-1) + x · F(k-2)`. This recurses down to `x · F(1) = x` and `x · F(2) = x` (shift-by-one). Multiplication is a tree of additions shaped exactly like the Fibonacci call tree from your original observation. **The algorithm's structure mirrors the number system's structure.** General multiplication between two arbitrary values decomposes the multiplier into its Zeckendorf digits and sums the shifted copies — analogous to long multiplication, but with φ-spaced shifts instead of uniform ones.

## Comparison, Branching, Division

**Comparison** is scan-from-top: first cell that differs determines order. Same principle as any positional system; the non-adjacency constraint doesn't interfere.

**Division** is repeated subtraction with φ-scaled shifting. Long division, but each trial subtraction shifts by Fibonacci positions. The quotient accumulates in Zeckendorf form naturally.

**The native gate** that doesn't exist elsewhere: **NORMALIZE.** Every other logic operation (AND, OR, NOT on raw cells) can produce invalid states. NORMALIZE sweeps the register back to validity. It's the primitive. It _is_ the computation.

## What This Machine is Good At

The φ-machine isn't a worse version of something else. It has intrinsic properties:

**Self-similar scaling.** Every substructure at scale n contains the structure at n-1 and n-2. This maps naturally to problems that are themselves recursive or fractal — tree traversals, branching processes, growth models.

**Built-in redundancy detection.** The adjacency constraint means the representation space is sparser than the raw bit space. This is a feature — it means encoding carries more structure per symbol, at the cost of more symbols per value.

**Natural compression delimiter.** The sequence `11` can never appear inside a valid number, so it's a free end-of-number marker. You can concatenate φ-encoded values in a stream with zero framing overhead. This is why Fibonacci codes already exist in data compression — they fell out of this system, not out of the legacy one.

**Gentle overflow.** When a register fills, it grows by one cell, increasing capacity by a factor of φ ≈ 1.618 rather than doubling. Growth is spiral, not exponential.

## The Dual Cost Structure

The matrix preserves its invariants under multiplication automatically. No normalization, no sweep — the dot product structure makes invalid states unreachable. The 1D register preserves its invariants via normalization — an explicit sweep because the flat address space doesn't enforce structure.

```
1D:      valid in + valid in → possibly invalid → normalize → valid out
Matrix:  valid in × valid in → valid out (guaranteed by dot product)
```

The normalization sweep in the 1D register is doing from the outside what the dot product does from the inside. The two representations are duals — each native where the other is expensive:

```
                        1D φ-Register         Matrix Register
Value addition          native (pour+norm)    expensive (decompose)
Index composition       expensive (matrix)    native (multiply)
Normalization           required              impossible to violate
Arbitrary integers      direct                only Fibonacci-indexed
Inspectable digits      yes                   no (opaque pair)
```

## The Switching Strategy

The matrix identity's practical consequence isn't a hybrid architecture — it's a decision framework. Since both representations are projections of the same object, converting between them is lossless and cheap. Stay in whichever projection fits the current operation.

**Value work → stay in 1D.** Addition, subtraction, comparison, reading individual digits. The normalization sweep is the right cost to pay. Converting to matrix form would require decomposition and reconstruction for no benefit.

**Composition work → switch to matrix.** Exponentiation, fast doubling, multiplying by Fibonacci numbers, advancing indices. Build the `(F(k), F(k+1))` pair from the Zeckendorf form — O(width), same cost as one normalization sweep — then compose via matrix multiplication with no further normalization. Convert back to 1D when done.

**Multiplication decomposes naturally.** The multiplier determines the structure: Zeckendorf-decompose it (1D work), then for each active digit, shift and add (1D work). The matrix enters only if you need to compute F(n) for large n, or if the multiplication is by a Fibonacci number (which is a single index shift in matrix form).

The startup cost of building the matrix pair from Zeckendorf form when you actually need it is O(width). That's the same cost as one normalization sweep. You don't pre-pay it — you convert on demand.

```
Operation           →  Representation  →  Why
Addition            →  1D register     →  pour and normalize
Subtraction         →  1D register     →  borrow and normalize
Comparison          →  1D register     →  scan from top
Fast doubling       →  matrix pair     →  square: (a,b) → (a(2b-a), a²+b²)
Exponentiation      →  matrix pair     →  compose via multiply
Multiply by F(k)    →  matrix pair     →  single index shift
General multiply    →  both            →  decompose in 1D, shift-add, matrix for F(k) lookup
```

## Matrix Exponentiation: Two Traversals

The recurrence `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` expressed as a matrix power:

```
[F(n+1)]   [1 1]^n   [1]
[F(n)  ] = [1 0]   × [0]
```

Two methods to compute M^n — same matrix, different cipher driving the traversal:

**Binary traversal (fast doubling).** Decompose n in binary. At each bit, square the pair. If the bit is 1, also multiply by M. This exploits the fact that squaring doubles the index: `(F(k), F(k+1)) → (F(2k), F(2k+1))`.

```
F(2k)   = F(k) · [2·F(k+1) - F(k)]
F(2k+1) = F(k)² + F(k+1)²
```

**Fibonacci traversal (ladder).** Maintain two consecutive Fibonacci-indexed powers `M^F(k-1)` and `M^F(k)`. Combine them to get `M^F(k+1)`. Climb the ladder to the largest Zeckendorf term, then assemble remaining terms.

```
M^F(k) = M^F(k-1) × M^F(k-2)    — the recurrence in the exponent
```

Both are O(log n). Fast doubling uses fewer scalar operations (~3 muls per step × log₂(n) steps). The ladder uses ~1 matrix multiply per step × log_φ(n) ≈ 1.44 log₂(n) steps. Same matrix underneath, different decomposition of the same exponent.

## The Core Insight

The φ-register isn't an alternative to binary. Both are lossy projections of a 2D structure onto a 1D bit string, each preserving different properties and paying different costs. The matrix is where they meet — binary-indexed rows and columns, Fibonacci-valued entries. Binary as the address bus, Fibonacci as the data bus, the matrix as the interface.
